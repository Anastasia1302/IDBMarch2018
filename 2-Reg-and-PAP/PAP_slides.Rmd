# Little experiment [10mins]

## Explanation to participants

### Read and complete the sheet: DO NOT LOOK AT OTHERS SHEETS

### Go to the website bellow and complete with your answers.

## Explanation to researchers

### You just participated in (highly simplified) version of **The Ultimatum Game**

### The goal of the UG is to measure attitudes about fairness and/or expectations about (econ) rational behavior. 

### Our little experiment was trying to measure if the responses to the UG can be anchored by a completly irrelevant number:
The ID number at the beginning of your sheet!

## Explanation to researchers

### Treatment was receiving an ID number between 960 and 999.
### Control receive an ID number between 10 and 49.

### Outcome: Offer made in the UG

### For the hands-on excercise, you can use this experiment, or work with your own paper/project. 

# Registration: [40 mins]

## Why Register? Publication Bias [1 min version]
![](Tess.png)

## Why Register? Publication Bias [10 min version]
### Effect sizes diminish with sample size (Gerber, Green, Nickerson 2001).

### There is a higher fraction of rejected hypothesis tests in social compared to hard sciences (Fanelli 2010).

### Published null results are disappearing over time, in all disciplines (Fanelli 2011).

### The file drawer problem is large. (Turner et al 2008, Franco et al. 2014)

## Hands-on Registration.
Based on a project of your own, or on our little experiment:  

 - Create a draft of using [Open Science Framework](osf.io) at [osf.io](osf.io):  
     - Open format
     - AsPredicted (will work with this one)
  
 - Explore [AEA Registry](www.socialscienceregistry.org) at [www.socialscienceregistry.org](www.socialscienceregistry.org)

## Registration of our Little Experiment 
Using Aspredicted format:    
\pause  
 - **Research question:** Does exposure to a large number increases the offer made in the ultimatum game?  
\pause  
 - **Dependent variable:** Amount offered in the ultimatum game.   
\pause  
 - **Manipulation/Conditions:**  Participant will be randomly assigned a large number ([960, 999]) or a small number ([10, 49]) to be read and remember, before reading the ultimatum game question.   
\pause    
 - **Analyses:** OLS regression of amount offer as dependant variable and treatment as regressor.     
\pause    
 - **Outliers and Exclusions:** Will exclude participants with missing information in any field. Amounts beyond plausible values (eg offers above max dollar value) will be will be top-coded.   
\pause  
 - **Sample size: ** We will define our sample by the number of participants in the workshop.   

# Pre-analysis Plan. [20mins]

## Why Do We Need PAPs?
![](GoBifo1.PNG)

## Why Do We Need PAPs? (cont)

* Increases replicability  
* Distinguishes exploratory from confirmatory analysis  
* You can win $1000!

## How to do a PAP? McKenzie Suggestions
[World Bank Development Impact Blog](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/a-pre-analysis-plan-checklist)

 - Description of the sample to be used in the study  
 - Key data sources  
 - Hypotheses to be tested throughout the causal chain  
 - Specify how variables will be constructed  
 - Specify the treatment effect equation to be estimated  
 - What is the plan for how to deal with multiple outcomes and multiple
  hypothesis testing?  
 - Procedures to be used for addressing survey attrition  
 - How will the study deal with outcomes with limited variation?  
 - If you are going to be testing a model, include the model  
 - Remember to archive it

# Reporting Guidelines [20mins]

## Why Do We Need Reporting Guidelines?  
Defines minimal set of elements required in a scientific paper. 
Helps with:  
 - Structured PAPs  
 - Replicability    
 - Meta-analysis    
 
 
## How to follow Reporting Guidelines  
 - CONSORT Guidelines & EQUATOR network.
 - Recent APA guidelines.
 - JDE suggested guidelines for register reports.
