# Little experiment [10mins]

# Registration: [40 mins]

## Why Register? Publication Bias

## Hands-on Registration.
Based on a project of your own, or on our little experiment:  

 - Create a draft of a AEA Registry (emph IRB)  
 - Explore OSF:  
     - AsPredicted  
     - Open format  

## Registration of our Little Experiment [THIS SLIDE WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE WORKSHOP]
Using Aspredicted format:  
   - **Research question:** Does exposure to a large number increases the offer made in the ultimatum game?  
   - **Dependent variable:** Amount offered in the ultimatum game.   
   - **Manipulation/Conditions:**  Participant will be randomly assigned a large number ([960, 999]) or a small number ([10, 49]) to be read and remember, before reading the ultimatum game question. 
   - **Analyses:** OLS regression of amount offer as dependant variable and treatment as regressor.   
   - **Outliers and Exclusions:** Will exclude participants with missing information in any field. Amounts beyond plausible values (eg offers above max dollar value) will be will be top-coded.   
   - **Sample size: ** We will define our sample by the number of participants in the workshop.   

# Pre-analysis Plan. [20mins]

## Why Do We Need PAPs?

## Why Do We Need PAPs? (cont)

* Increases replicability  
* 

## How to do a PAP?
Mckenzie bullet point  

## How to do a PAP?
 - Pre-reg Challenge (emph IRB)  
 - RR at JDE

 
# Reporting Guidelines [20mins]

## Why Do We Need Reporting Guidelines?  
Defines minimal set of elements required in a scientific paper. 
Helps with:
 - Structured PAPs
 - Replicability  
 - Meta-analysis  
 
 
## How to follow Reporting Guidelines  
 - CONSORT Guidelines & EQUATOR network.
 - Recent APA guidelines.
 - JDE suggested guidelines for register reports.
