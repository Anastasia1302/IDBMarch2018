You have been given $1000 dollars with the condition that you have to share it with the person right next to you. You get to do one offer, if the recipient accepts, each takes the agreed offer. If the recipient rejects the offer, no body gets anything. Please write down your offer. Go to the survey website, and complete the required information

Now write down how much would you offer if you were given $10 dollars.

Why not
How to match it to your current work practices.


Add slides on PAP list
Add P-hacking emails

RCT --> AEA
Non-exp in dev --> 3ie
Non-exp in dev --> OSF

PAP - why at indiv. level

I don't want to get scooped.




1. PAPs - Johannes had a nice presentation in Norway which not only defined PAPs but also talked about benefits/costs in a useful way - https://berkeley.app.box.com/file/208438401148 Something that always comes up - not just how, but WHEN do you write one - I think there are multiple answers based on your objectives for doing one and each should be presented
2. Reg + PAPs - Garret's presentation from INSP is also a very useful reference and also includes useful references for development researchers (to 3ie, etc) which are relevant for this audience. One thing I'll flag is the right balance for a hands-on exercise - you're taking a small gamble with the new exercise; would the same thing be accomplished by looking at his P-Hacking is Fun slide and playing with one of these? - https://github.com/BITSS/INSP2017/blob/master/2-Reg-and-PAP/Reg_PAPslides.pdf
3. Reporting - I think the session from RT2 is a helpful reference - https://berkeley.app.box.com/folder/38693002716
